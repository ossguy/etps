So I don't forget, here's how I came up with "eTPS"/what it represents:

* E.164, TelXM, PSTN, and Soprani.ca
* an old school play on the "eWhatever" style and a tribute to TPS reports
* a way of differentiating it from "ETPs" so I'm never confused with anything finance
* perhaps the 'P' is just for planning, plus the tribute to "eWhatever", then the actual projects of mine, TelXM and Soprani.ca
